# Just a pair of eyes watching every move your mouse makes.
This page uses HTML, CSS, and JS to to make a page with a solid background color and used CSS to shape the pair of eyes in the middle of the page. It uses JS to have the eyes move around following where ever the mouse pointer is. I would like to add more eyes so the page comes out slightly creepy, in a funny way!!
## For future improvements, run the page with holiday themes. Eater bunnny with eyes that follow carrots around the page, for example.
### How to Run
When the page is executed, all the user needs to do is click the mouse somewhere on the page and that activates the eyes to follow the mouse around the page.
